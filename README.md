# Deep Q Network with Pygame Learning Environment-Tensorflow

Implementation of the deep neural net first introduced by DeepMind to play Atari game to allow it to use the PLE framework on Tensorflow

The repository can be opened as a PyCharm Project directly

## Dependencies

1. Tensorflow (tested on 1.0) + Nvidia GPU
2. Python 3.5
3. Pygame Learning Environment + Pygame
4. opencv3
5. Numpy

## Running the code

```

python runDQN.py

Tensorboard logs will be saved in the ./saved folder and networks in the ./saved/

```
